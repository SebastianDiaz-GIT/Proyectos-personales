So she got that booty poppin' like it's bubblegum, gum
Beat up on that booty like, rum-pum-pum pum
Will not listen to your bullshit, nah-nah-nah nah
Baby Gravy droppin' heat like, rah-tah-tah tah
Pour your bitch a lil' Courvoisier
Yoko Ono came through with the yay
Roll more blunts up, baby, andele
Let's get lit like it's a holiday
My name is Baby No Money let me tell you again
I change the no to yes and now everybody claims they're my friend
You find the Baby Gravy on the top and we will not descend
I got the pepperoni pizza, Fendi frames and blue cheese lens, yeah
No stains on my white G-Fazos
Wanted 20 mil, turn my shit to pesos
Got a billi when I cucked Jeff Bezos
Hey Alexa I'm playin' baby please don't take me off payroll
So she got that booty poppin' like it's bubblegum, gum
Beat up on that booty like, rum-pum-pum pum
Will not listen to your bullshit, nah-nah-nah nah
Baby Gravy droppin' heat like, rah-tah-tah tah
Pour your bitch a lil' Courvoisier
Yoko Ono came through with the yay
Roll more blunts up, baby, andele
Let's get lit like it's a holiday
Hey Gravy
Hey Baby
What's good bitch?
Every day I wake up and I'm back on my bullshit
How come every time I say a word it's some good shit
I was born a Mac I be on some Fleetwood shit
I'ma stay givin' miniscule fucks
You need aim bot pussy boy you a crutch
Gravy baby start crime we Starsky Hutch
Ha, ayy
Star studded event when I valet park
I think I'm Paul Wall dripped in the rally car
I like a blunt mixed up with some caviar
I like your mom but shit she gave me battle scars
Got that booty poppin' like it's bubblegum, gum
Beat up on that booty like, rum-pum-pum pum
Will not listen to your bullshit, nah-nah-nah nah
Baby Gravy droppin' heat like, rah-tah-tah tah
Pour your bitch a lil' Courvoisier
Yoko Ono came through with the yay
Roll more blunts up, baby, andele
Let's get lit like it's a holiday
